title: Database URLs and dev databases
description: Accepted database URL formats, and the difference between the target, dev, shadow, and throwaway databases.
---

Every Ptah command that touches a database takes a URL, and the URL's scheme
selects the engine. The same URL syntax names databases in four different
roles, though — the target you are changing, plus up to three kinds of
disposable databases that exist so mistakes happen somewhere harmless. This
page defines all four; other pages link here instead of redefining them.

## URL formats

| Engine | Example |
| --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL | `postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/app` |
| MySQL | `mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/app` (Go-driver form `mysql://user:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/app` is also accepted) |
| MariaDB | `mariadb://user:pass@localhost:3306/app` |
| SQLite | `sqlite://relative.db`, `sqlite:///absolute/path/app.db`, `sqlite:///:memory:`, `sqlite:file:memdb1?mode=memory&cache=shared` |
| SQL Server | `sqlserver://sa:pass@localhost:1433?database=app` (plus a Ptah-only `schema` parameter — see [SQL Server](../../databases/sqlserver/)) |
| ClickHouse | `clickhouse://user:pass@localhost:9000/app` |
| CockroachDB | `cockroachdb://user:pass@localhost:26257/app` |
| YugabyteDB | `yugabytedb://user:pass@localhost:5433/app` |
| Spanner (PostgreSQL interface) | `spanner://user:pass@localhost:5432/app` |

Scheme aliases normalize to the canonical dialect (`postgresql://`,
`sqlite3://`, `mssql://`, `crdb://`, `ysql://`, `ch://`, and more) — the full
alias list is on the
[Database support matrix](../../databases/support-matrix/). A URL with an
unrecognized scheme fails with `unsupported database dialect`.

## The four database roles

**The target database** is the one a command reads or changes: `--db-url` on
native commands, `--url` on Atlas-compatible ones. It is the only database
whose state matters after the command exits.

**A dev database** (`--dev-url`) is a disposable replay target used for
validation: `ptah migrations validate` and `ptah migrations lint` clean it and
replay the migration directory on it to prove the SQL executes, and
Atlas-compatible verbs use it for planning and linting the same way.

**A shadow database** (`--shadow-db`) is a disposable verification target for
commands that write or record migrations: `ptah migrations generate` replays
the directory — including the new migration, up, down, and up again — before
keeping any files, and `ptah migrations checkpoint` and
`ptah migrations baseline` use it to verify that migrations reproduce the
expected schema before anything is recorded.

**A throwaway test database** is what `ptah migrations test` and
`ptah schema test` run cases against: by default a fresh ephemeral SQLite
database per case, or the database passed with `--db-url` when tests must
exercise a real server dialect — see
[Test migrations and schemas](../../testing/migrations-and-schema/).

## Consequences

- **Disposable means dropped.** Dev and shadow databases are cleaned on every
  run, and test seed steps bypass the seeder's protected-environment guards.
  Point these flags at scratch databases only, never at a real environment.
- **Match the target engine.** Replay verification proves the SQL executes on
  the engine it ran against, so a dev or shadow database should run the same
  engine (and ideally the same version) as the target.
- **Every flag has an environment variable.** `PTAH_DB_URL`, `PTAH_DEV_URL`,
  and `PTAH_SHADOW_DB` set the corresponding flags, which keeps credentials
  out of CI command lines — see [Configuration](../../reference/configuration/).

## Where it appears

- Replay validation and linting with a dev database: [Integrity and safety](../../versioned/integrity-and-safety/).
- Shadow-verified generation and baselining: [Generate migrations](../../versioned/generate/) and [Adopt an existing database](../../start/adopt-an-existing-database/).
- Engine-specific URL behavior: [Database support matrix](../../databases/support-matrix/).
