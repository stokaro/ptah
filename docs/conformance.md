# Atlas Conformance

Ptah's Atlas conformance scoreboard is maintained in the dedicated
[`stokaro/ptah-atlas-conformance`](https://github.com/stokaro/ptah-atlas-conformance)
repository.

That repository is the authoritative, CI-regenerated answer to "are we there
yet?" for Atlas OSS compatibility. It keeps Atlas's Apache-2.0 fixture corpus
outside Ptah's MIT source tree while importing Ptah as the system under test.
The dependency direction is intentionally one-way:

```text
ptah-atlas-conformance -> ptah
ptah                  !-> ptah-atlas-conformance
```

## Current Scoreboard

As of Ptah `18ae5f9d4d63136248986263732524e2314f9d7c`:

| Tier | Purpose | Current result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Offline Atlas corpus | Can Ptah ingest Atlas OSS fixture artifacts through public APIs? | 636 ok, 0 gap, 0 fail, 0 panic |
| Live round-trip | Can Ptah generate, apply, introspect, and diff first-party schemas on real databases? | 8 ok, 2 known gaps |
| Atlas CE differential | Do Atlas CE and Ptah agree on live end-state facts for shared fixtures? | 1 ok, 4 known gaps |
| CLI surface | Do Atlas CE and Ptah expose compatible command paths, help boundaries, flags, and runtime classifications? | Tracked in `cli-surface.md` |

The offline full-conformance gate is green. The live and differential full gates
remain intentionally red until the known gaps are closed, while their regression
budgets stay green when the reports are current and no new gaps appear.

## Workflow Parity

Workflow capabilities that do not add schema objects are recorded separately
from the round-trip corpus:

| Workflow | Native Ptah | Atlas-compatible Ptah surface | Atlas CE | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Declarative migration and schema tests | `ptah migrations test` and `ptah schema test` run YAML/Go-authored cases locally. | `ptah atlas migrate test` and `ptah atlas schema test` remain explicit Atlas CE unsupported-boundary stubs. | Cannot run either testing command; the framework is outside the open-source core. | Unit tests cover parsing, assertions, reporting, and CLI behavior; integration-tagged PostgreSQL tests exercise both live runners. This workflow is not counted as a schema-object round-trip fixture. |

This row records product workflow parity, not full Atlas Pro compatibility. Ptah
does not expose the native runner as a root-level Atlas alias.

## Local Commands

From this repository:

```bash
make conformance
```

From `ptah-atlas-conformance`:

```bash
make probe        # regenerate gaps.md / gaps.json
make budget       # offline regression budget
make gate         # full offline parity gate
make probe-live   # live DB round-trip report
make budget-live  # live DB regression budget
make gate-live    # full live parity gate
make probe-diff   # Atlas CE differential report
make budget-diff  # Atlas CE differential regression budget
make probe-orm-providers   # pinned GORM and SQLAlchemy provider report
make budget-orm-providers  # ORM provider regression budget
make gate-orm-providers    # full ORM provider gate
make probe-cli-surface   # Atlas CE CLI surface report
make budget-cli-surface  # Atlas CE CLI surface regression budget
make gate-cli-surface    # full CLI surface parity gate
```

Live and differential commands require real database URLs, and the differential
tier also requires an Atlas CE binary built from the pinned `atlas.version` in
the conformance repository.

## External Schema Coverage

The deterministic offline report includes a 20-observation external-schema
workflow. It covers static SQL files; external programs that emit SQL, HCL, and
YAML; the opt-in trust boundary for render, compare, drift, plan, and generate;
configuration and explicit CLI sources; migration generation and application
to an ephemeral SQLite database; table, primary-key, unique-index, and
cascading-foreign-key facts; and converged compare, drift, plan, and generate
results.

A separate ORM-provider tier installs pinned GORM and SQLAlchemy providers in
temporary isolated environments. Its regression-budget job requires the
committed report to remain current without adding non-OK results, while its
independent full gate requires every provider-output and Ptah-render
observation to pass.

This evidence applies to Ptah's native external-program source. It does not
claim evaluation of Atlas HCL `data.external_schema`, which remains a distinct
Atlas project-language feature.
